    """
    Simple task that has a trivial payload: converting integers into ascii characters. The task is
    designed to be a workflow with 26 branches. Each branch creates one character (a-z) and saves
    it to a json output file. While branches are numbered continuously from 0 to n-1, the actual
    data it processes is defined in the *branch_map*. A task can access this data via
    ``self.branch_map[self.branch]``, or via ``self.branch_data`` by convenience.

    By default, CreateChars is a LocalWorkflow (first workflow class in the inheritance order, MRO).
    If you want to execute it on Crab, add ``"--workflow crab"`` parameter on the command line, or
    ``"--workflow htcondor"`` for HTCondor. The code in this task should be completely independent
    of the actual *run location*, and law provides the means to do so.

    When a branch greater or equal to zero is set, e.g. via ``"--branch 1"``, you instantiate a
    single *branch task* rather than the workflow. Branch tasks are always executed locally.
